        <p>
          Start DJing with our easy-to-use DDJ-200 smart DJ controller.
          Lightweight and compact with a pro-style layout, it’ll help you learn
          to mix and, if you want to, develop DJing from a hobby into something
          more. Put your own twist on the music as you mix for friends at
          parties. Play tracks via your smartphone or PC/Mac using a variety of
          DJ apps and software including our dedicated, free app WeDJ for iPhone
          or WeDJ for Android, as well as djay and edjing Mix. Depending on your
          device and the program you choose, you can mix music stored in your
          iTunes or rekordbox library, or stream songs from Beatport LINK,
          SoundCloud Go+, Deezer, TIDAL or even Beatsource LINK.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quickly develop your mixing skills with the help of the Tutorial and
          Pop-Hint features in WeDJ for iPhone. These functions will teach you
          about the hardware and help you understand DJ terms. Your hands will
          be flying between the DDJ-200’s jog wheels, buttons and knobs when
          you’re done. And we’ve added Transition FX to help you match phrases
          and smoothly transition between songs. This beginner DJ controller
          will have you dropping mixes and playing friends’ requests like you’ve
          been doing it for years.
