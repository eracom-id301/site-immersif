          Start DJing with our easy-to-use DDJ-200 smart DJ controller.
          Lightweight and compact with a pro-style layout, it’ll help you learn
          to mix and, if you want to, develop DJing from a hobby into something
          more. Put your own twist on the music as you mix for friends at
          parties. Play tracks via your smartphone or PC/Mac using a variety of
          DJ apps and software including our dedicated, free app WeDJ for iPhone
          or WeDJ for Android, as well as djay and edjing Mix. Depending on your
          device and the program you choose, you can mix music stored in your
          iTunes or rekordbox library, or stream songs from Beatport LINK,
          SoundCloud Go+, Deezer, TIDAL or even Beatsource LINK.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quickly develop your mixing skills with the help of the Tutorial and
          Pop-Hint features in WeDJ for iPhone. These functions will teach you
          about the hardware and help you understand DJ terms. Your hands will
          be flying between the DDJ-200’s jog wheels, buttons and knobs when
          you’re done. And we’ve added Transition FX to help you match phrases
          and smoothly transition between songs. This beginner DJ controller
          will have you dropping mixes and playing friends’ requests like you’ve
          been doing it for years.
        </p>
        <h3>Compatible apps</h3>
        <p>
          Connect your smartphone, tablet, or PC/Mac to start mixing. A number
          of software programs and apps – including WeDJ for iPhone, WeDJ for
          Android, djay, edjing Mix and rekordbox – are compatible with selected
          devices. You’ll also have free use of all the features in WeDJ for
          iPhone that normally require in-app payments.
        </p>
        <h3>Compatible streaming sites</h3>
        <p>
          Depending on your app and device combo, you can mix sounds via
          streaming services including Beatport LINK, SoundCloud Go+, Deezer,
          TIDAL, and even Beatsource LINK. WeDJ for Android is not compatible
          with streaming services.

          features. They’ll help you learn how to operate the controller,
          discover the basics of DJing including common DJ terms, and have you
          mixing in no time.

          it sound professional with the Transition FX feature in WeDJ for
          iPhone. Choose from 11 effect styles and simply slide the crossfader
          to the other side to smoothly switch tunes.

        <h3>Compact lightweight body</h3>
        <p>
          The DDJ-200 is lightweight and portable. Leave the speakers at home
          and play sound from your smartphone, tablet, or PC/Mac’s audio
          outputs. No outlet handy? No problem. Power the controller via an
          external battery.
